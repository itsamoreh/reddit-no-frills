# reddit-no-frills

Very simple, clean reddit theme. I got sick of reddit being ugly and decided to make this!

Add code to a usertheme or [install with stylish here](https://userstyles.org/styles/126393/reddit-no-frills).

Make sure to turn off subreddit styles (Settings > Display > Allow subreddits to show me custom themes). Or edit the theme to make it only apply to your frontpage.

Sidebar accessible by hovering over the icon at the top right.

Let me know if anything needs fixing at the Github repository's [Issues Tab](https://github.com/itsamoreh/reddit-no-frills/issues).
